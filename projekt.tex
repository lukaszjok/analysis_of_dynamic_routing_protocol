\begin{abstract}
During the last few decades all kind of computer networks has rapidly grown. It is noticeable espacially in big companies, which have their own data centres. They require  special solutions, diffrent in diffrent data centres. This solutions have to cope the most difficult requirements. It is very important to choose wisely diffrent kinds of mechanism used in networks in example proper dynamic routing protocol. It is hard to say which one will be optimal in diffrent cases. In this paper, we will investigate which popular dynamic routing protocol is the best in given cases. We also compare them with latest trend in networks – Software-Defined Networking.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}

Computer networks is one of the fastest growing area of technology in these days. At the begining, they were used usually to communicate between people or to share a files. Nowadays modern networks brings much more functions: printer sharings, video conferencing, streaming video and music, entertainment and more. Large data centres use lots of applications and technologies which make work easier and more efficient. Therefore modern network must be fast and efficient too.
\\
In past networks were diffrent. For example it was necessary to have equipment made by the same vendor. Otherwise computers, printers or something else cannot communicate with each other. This problem was solved introducing the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). The OSI model was meant to help vendors create interoperable network devices and software in the form of protocols so that networks from different vendors could work with each other.
\\
Actually, the most popular network layer protocol for connecting computer networks is Internet Protocol (IP). Network layer is responsible mostly for finding the best way from one host from one subnet to another host in another subnet. It is very difficult, especially in large networks. However, there are dynamic routing protocols, which do it automatically. Nowadays, the most widely used intra domain routing protocols are Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), Intermediate System to Intermediate System (IS-IS) and Rounting Information Protocol (RIP). Lately, Software-Defined Networking were introduced. It is new solution for networks and it is said it will be future of networking. It is new kind of technology.
\\
This article shows real time and simulation comparative between dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF, EIGRP, IS-IS, RIP and new solution – SDN. Realistic survey were made using Cisco routers and the simulations were carried out by using the GNS3 simulator.

\section{Related words}

Works [1-5 and 7-11] testing the routing protocols using diffrent simulators, like: OPNET, GNS3, NT-3 and Cisco. In their studies, authors of works [1-5 and 7-11], create variuos senarios to compare performance of protocols such as EIGRP, OSPF, RIP, IS-IS. They usually survey convergence duration, traffic sent, link utilization, throughput and bandwidth. E. Shewandagn Lemma, S. A. Hussain, W. W. Anjelo, S. Farhangi, A. Rostami, S. Golmohammadi, as in [1-2], also were testing combination of various dynamic routing protocols. Articles [16-20] present solutions used in Software-Defined Networking. Authors shows thier own algorithms, combinations of existing technology or compare existing technology with well known dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF.
